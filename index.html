            Visual Studios is a app where we can code using html, js and css. First you have to download Visual Studios, then open it.
            Go to the last icon on the left hand side, extensions. Search Live Sever and download it.
            Now go to the first icon on the left hand side, Explorer. Create a folder on your desktop and come back to Visual Studios,
